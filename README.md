# War Card Game
The card game “War” built as a local multiplayer iOS game! The rules of the original are kept intact; each player draws a card from a standard 52-card deck, and whichever player’s card is higher gets two points. If both cards have the same value, they enter war, and three additional cards are drawn to determine the winner! The game ends once all cards have been drawn from the deck.

# Usage
You can open war-card-game.xcodeproj in Xcode and build the app to try it on Simulator!
